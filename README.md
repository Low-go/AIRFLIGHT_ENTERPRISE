This project aims to create a sophisticated, visualized node-based, tree-structured hierarchical relational database model. It is designed for a company that manages the supply and replacement of aircraft parts for various company fleets.

The project utilizes a React-Django framework, PostgreSQL database, and React Flow to implement a visualized database tree. This setup allows the company to efficiently manage its numerous subsidiaries, contacts, forms, fleets, parts, and projected part replacements. The application will feature a window for displaying data and information, and another for showcasing the visualized model.

I hope to stay committed to this project. I'm starting it before the beginning of a new semester, so progress might be a bit slow initially.
